# Admin-Portal
This is the php source code and database information used to create the Admin Portal for COSC 4351 Software Engineering. 

## Usage
To use these files, we recommend using WAMP to host the application on localhost.

In order to ensure that proper database connectivity, please ensure that the database listed in config.php is the same database you are using. The database should match the database that our sample data was imported to.
Once the database and Apache are deployed properly, navigate to localhost/index.php to start using the Admin Portal.
